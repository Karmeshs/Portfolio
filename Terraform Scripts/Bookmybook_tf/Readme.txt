This project was to create 2 ECS services in production environment for the client. Already 4 services were running.
First requirement was to have all infra (new + existing) imported and created in terraform. Reason for commented modules
Later only 2 new services were asked to be created through terraform without modifying existing resources.
Script was successfully deployed in non-prod and Production environments.
